### Invisibility Cloak with OpenCV and Ultrasonic Transducer

Invisibility Cloak with OpenCV. If you want to do something secretly, wear this cloak. But everyone should wear glasses made with our program using OpenCV. Even so, if someone has a detector built with a Raspberry Pi and Ultrasonic sensor, you'll be caught in no time with a loud buzzer sound and detect of indication on L2C LCD. The detector can be controlled through a Flask-based web browser interface created in HTML & CSS. If you're computer engineer, try controlling the detector by intercepting the signals that communicate in the middle.

This program is based on Raspberry Pi 4, and the sensor is controlled by python.

If you want to make this program yourself, please refer to **[here]()**
